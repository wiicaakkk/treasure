An additional lodge was constructed in 1992, providing even more room for classes visiting the area as a retreat or to use the Baca as a base for field work in the San Luis Valley. The valley, surrounded by the Sangre de Cristo and San Juan mountain ranges, is a major agricultural area, rich in natural resources and recreational opportunities and borders a major wilderness area and the Great Sand Dunes National Park. The college's Hulbert Center for Southwest Studies manages the Baca, though classes of all types use the campus.
